These are on the forum page, but either they're not on the site or their filenames don't match with what's expected:

1.0.0_HD_B
1.0.0_HD_A
1.0.0_HD_S_A
1.0.0_HD_MT_A

These are also on the forum page, but they lead to obfuscated adfly links and also either they're not on the OF website or I can't guess their filenames correctly:

Optimine 1.8.1
LagSpikeOfDeath 1.8.1
LagSpikeOfDeath 1.7.3
LagSpikesOfDeath_Fix 1.6.6
